There’s no light
Mama, I can’t see at all
There’s no one left to break this fall
Mama, there’s no one at all
Part 2: Hangman
Semi tabellio prima
Retracto quemadmodum callum
Odi cimussiato bora
Victum calefia doleo
Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama
Effascinatio crea
Tichius nova lumen patior
Esto mi doleo solor
Vivax olor ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inomina montis
I don’t know, won’t get out alive, yeah
I think I am gonna spend my last night here
I think I can finally see clear
When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you’ve lost control
Don’t take your soul
Sono o no ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inonima montis
I don’t know, won’t get out alive, yeah
Time flies by the rank of years
Humans die by the hand of fear
When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you’ve lost control
Don’t take your soul
In the time of the light before humans had the sight
Spent my life living blind with a picture in my mind
A vision of the sun but now my life is done
As I wait for the light to come, I will take nothing
For what I would bring that won’t decompose
As my body is disposed and the earth weights a ton
And now my life is done as I wait for the light to come
When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you’ve lost control
Don’t take your soul
Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama
Effascinatio crea
Tichius nova lumen patior
Esto mi doleo solor
Vivax olor ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inomina montis
I don’t know, won’t get out alive, yeah
